# Horizontal Alignment and List Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Horizontal Alignment Functionality

**Previous Problem:**
- Alignment buttons (left, center, right) were not working properly with active text selections
- Only applied styles to the entire text element, not to selected text within the rich text editor
- Alignment state detection was unreliable

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Added dedicated alignment methods to RichTextEditor:**
  - `applyAlignment(alignment)` - Applies alignment using both CSS styles and execCommand
  - `getCurrentAlignment()` - Reliably detects current alignment from multiple sources
- **Enhanced `setAlign()` function:**
  - Now uses RichTextEditor's dedicated alignment methods
  - Maintains element-level styles for consistency
  - Proper fallback handling when editor is not available
- **Improved alignment detection:**
  - Checks editor's direct CSS style first (most reliable)
  - Falls back to execCommand state detection
  - Uses computed styles as final fallback
- **Better initialization:**
  - Sets initial alignment when RichTextEditor is mounted
  - Maintains alignment styles in both editing and display modes
- Added `onMouseDown={preventToolbarMouseDown}` to prevent focus loss during button clicks

### 2. List Functionality

**Previous Problems:**
- `getEditableEl()` function incorrectly tried to access `selected?.ref?.current`
- List buttons were not properly interfacing with the rich text editor
- List state detection was not working correctly

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Fixed `getEditableEl()` to properly get the active editor node via `getActiveEditorHandle()`
- Completely rewrote `setListStyle()` function to work with the rich text editor:
  - Properly focuses the editor before applying changes
  - Uses `document.execCommand()` for list creation/removal
  - Handles switching between different list types correctly
  - Applies proper CSS list styles (disc, decimal, upper-roman, upper-alpha)
  - Triggers input events to save changes
- Added `getCurrentListStyle()` helper function to detect current list state
- Enhanced button active state detection for all list types
- Added proper error handling for list operations

### 3. Button State Management

**Improvements:**
- All alignment and list buttons now show correct active states
- Buttons properly reflect the current formatting of selected text
- Added `preventToolbarMouseDown` to all formatting buttons to prevent editor focus loss
- Enhanced selection change handling to update button states in real-time

## Technical Details

### Functions Added/Modified:

**In Toolbar.jsx:**
1. **`setAlign(align)`** - Enhanced to use RichTextEditor's alignment methods
2. **`getCurrentAlignment()`** - Simplified to use RichTextEditor's detection method
3. **`getCurrentListStyle()`** - Detects current list type
4. **`getEditableEl()`** - Fixed to work with rich text editor
5. **`setListStyle(listType)`** - Complete rewrite for proper list handling

**In RichTextEditor.jsx:**
6. **`applyAlignment(alignment)`** - New method for reliable alignment application
7. **`getCurrentAlignment()`** - New method for multi-source alignment detection
8. **Initialization improvements** - Sets initial alignment on editor mount

### Button Enhancements:

- All alignment buttons (left, center, right) now use `getCurrentAlignment()` for active state
- All list buttons (none, bullet, number, roman, alpha) now use `getCurrentListStyle()` for active state  
- Added `onMouseDown={preventToolbarMouseDown}` to all formatting buttons
- Enhanced `useEffect` to monitor selection changes and update button states

## How to Test

1. **Horizontal Alignment:**
   - Create a text element
   - Double-click to edit and select some text
   - Click alignment buttons - text should align correctly
   - Buttons should highlight to show current alignment

2. **List Functionality:**
   - Create a text element  
   - Double-click to edit and select text
   - Click list buttons (bullet, number, roman, alpha) - lists should be created
   - Switch between list types - formatting should change correctly
   - Click "None" to remove list formatting

3. **Button States:**
   - All buttons should properly highlight when their formatting is active
   - Selection changes should update button highlighting in real-time

## Files Modified

- `src/components/Toolbar.jsx` - Enhanced alignment and list functionality
- `src/components/RichTextEditor.jsx` - Added dedicated alignment methods and improved initialization
- No UI changes were made, only functional enhancements

The application should now have fully functional horizontal alignment and list formatting tools that work seamlessly with the rich text editor.
