# Horizontal Alignment Test Instructions

## The Issue Was:
The horizontal alignment buttons (Left/Center/Right) were not working because:
1. The CSS `textAlign` property doesn't work with `display: flex`
2. We need to use `justifyContent` instead for flex containers

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. **SlideCanvas.jsx** - Display Mode
- Changed from `textAlign` to `justifyContent` for flex containers
- Maps alignment values correctly:
  - `left` → `flex-start`
  - `center` → `center`
  - `right` → `flex-end`
  - `justify` → `space-between`

### 2. **Toolbar.jsx** - setAlign Function  
- Properly updates element styles (source of truth)
- Applies alignment to active editor immediately
- Calls emitChange() to persist the alignment

### 3. **RichTextEditor.jsx** - Editor Component
- Simplified alignment application
- Added emitChange() to exposed interface
- Alignment is applied via inline style on the contentEditable div

## How to Test:

1. **Start the dev server** (if not already running):
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add a text element**:
   - Click "+ Text" button in the toolbar
   - Double-click the text element to enter edit mode
   - Type some text (e.g., "Test Alignment")

3. **Test alignment while editing**:
   - With the text element selected and in edit mode
   - Click the alignment buttons in the toolbar (⟸ Left, ≡ Center, ⟹ Right)
   - The text should immediately change alignment

4. **Test alignment persistence**:
   - Click outside the text box to exit edit mode
   - The alignment should persist in display mode
   - Double-click to edit again - alignment should still be correct

5. **Test all three alignments**:
   - Left (⟸) - text aligns to the left edge
   - Center (≡) - text centers in the box
   - Right (⟹) - text aligns to the right edge

6. **Test with different content**:
   - Short text
   - Long text (that might overflow)
   - Text with formatting (bold, italic, underline)

## Expected Behavior:

✅ Alignment buttons should be responsive when text is selected
✅ Alignment should apply immediately and be visible
✅ Alignment should persist after exiting edit mode
✅ The active alignment button should be highlighted
✅ Alignment should work with all text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)

## If It's Still Not Working:

1. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5
2. **Check console**: Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for errors
3. **Restart dev server**: Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart `npm run dev`
4. **Verify changes were applied**: Check that dist/assets/index-*.js has new timestamp

## Technical Details:

The alignment system now uses a two-stage approach:
1. **Element Styles** - The `el.styles.align` property is the source of truth
2. **CSS Rendering** - Uses `justifyContent` for flex display mode to properly align content
