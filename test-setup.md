# PowerPoint Clone - Setup Verification

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Import Error in SlideCanvas.jsx
**Problem:** Line 4 contained an incorrect import:
```javascript
import { text } from 'express'
```

**Solution:** Removed the erroneous import statement since:
- 'express' is not a dependency in this React project
- The import was not being used anywhere in the code
- This would cause a module resolution error preventing the app from loading

### 2. Project Status
✅ **Dependencies installed:** All npm packages are up to date
✅ **Build successful:** Project builds without errors  
✅ **Development server:** Runs successfully on port 5175
✅ **No compilation errors:** All TypeScript/JavaScript files compile correctly

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at: http://localhost:5175/ (or another available port)

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure Node.js is installed (version 16+ recommended)
2. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check that no other services are using ports 5173-5175
4. Verify all imports are correct and dependencies are installed

The application should now load without any module resolution errors and display the PowerPoint-like interface successfully.
